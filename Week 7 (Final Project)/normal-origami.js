// With this, I will create and add new items to the normal origami page, as if they had been submitted by
// others, and I was approving them. They will appear below the projects that are already part of the html

// First, we need to create the spot for the items, including an <h2>, a <p>, and a <img>
// 


// element.classList.add()
